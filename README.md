### Extrac Tranform and Load of data using vocabulary UMLS
---

This project uses vocabulary extracted from UMLS, which is a unified and standardized medical language. UMLS offers an API to extract this data in a structured way in SQL.

<br/>

UMLS allows clinical language queries to know its semantic type. This vocabulary is used to create a rule-based model and perform queries from the extracted vocabulary. **The model created will be used in a web application.**
